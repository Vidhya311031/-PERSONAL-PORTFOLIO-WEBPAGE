##This project is a responsive single-page personal portfolio website developed using HTML5 and CSS3, aimed at creating a professional and visually appealing platform to showcase a developer’s work, skills, and achievements. The portfolio follows a minimal yet modern design approach, ensuring that the content remains the focal point while providing a smooth and engaging browsing experience. It consists of multiple well-structured sections, including:

-Home – A welcoming banner with the developer’s name, tagline, and a call-to-action button.

-About – A brief introduction highlighting the developer’s background, interests, and career goals.

-Skills – A visual representation of technical expertise and tools the developer is proficient in.

-Projects – A showcase of completed projects with descriptions, technologies used, and links for live demos or source code.

-Contact – Simple and accessible contact options, including email, phone, and social media links.

The design is fully responsive, adapting flawlessly to various screen sizes and devices such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Attention has been given to typography, color schemes, and layout balance to create a professional and consistent look. Smooth navigation is achieved through an intuitive header menu, allowing users to jump between sections without page reloads.

Beyond its visual appeal, this portfolio serves as a digital resume and personal branding tool, helping developers stand out in competitive fields. It is ideal for job applications, freelance opportunities, or showcasing skills to potential collaborators. By combining HTML and CSS best practices with responsive design principles, this project demonstrates both technical skills and an understanding of user experience (UX) design in modern web development.
